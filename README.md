Fitness:
To avoid steep drops in the fitness landscape between valid and invalid solutions, the fitness of a valid solution is its -cost, while the fitness of an invalid solution is given by the -cost of the elements it contains plus the -cost required to make the solution valid.

Strategy:
simulated annealing, more probable to accept not best solution when stuck after many iteration
